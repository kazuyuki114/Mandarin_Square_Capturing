O An Quan is a famous traditional game in Vietnam, especially among Vietnamese youth. Although the game contains many tactical and thinking elements, the game has quite simple rules and anyone can participate in this game. Due to the development of technology, traditional games are gradually modernized on electronic devices. Today, there are many game programs on the market, popular in both free and paid forms such as on mobile platforms (iOS, Android,..), on social networks ( Facebook, Zing Me,...), on online game sites such as Game 24h (Game24h.vn), Game Vui (gamevui.vn) or reach users through other less popular forms such as game client ( Zing play). However, the above games do not really pay attention to the user experience, operations as well as the images and animations that the game brings. This causes the game of O An Quan to gradually attract less attention and many people are unable to know this national cultural identity.
